Is our secret safe tonight?
And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart, and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed
